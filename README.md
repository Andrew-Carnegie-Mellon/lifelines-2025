- By team Byte Us: Enkhmunkh Enkhbayar, Furqan Saeed, Sun Choi, Sherkhan Bakdaulet

## Description

The following project addresses critical communication needs in crisis zones like Gaza and Lebanon, where traditional infrastructure is often destroyed. We are deploying low-cost, Arduino-based nodes to create a decentralized network, all powered by mini solar panels for standalone functionality. This system enables urgent requests, telemedicine, and humanitarian coordination in areas cut off from central services. Where the people specifically affected are the humanitarian personnel and civilians on ground.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install node modules to the each folder backend and frontend
